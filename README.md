# Lofi-Funkin-Macos
This is the Lofi mod for FnF but built for mac instead of windows


In the case that you're running this on a school macbook and can't run games without permissions, simply right click or double finger click the Lofi-Funkin file you download here and show package contents. After this create a new folder on your desktop or wherever you're storing your games you can leave it untitled for now. Drag the files you found in the package contents earlier into the new untitled folder. You can now rename that new folder to "Lofi-Funkin.app" then press the keep button to keep it as .app.

For those who don't understand the average computer very well. And executable is an app file that runs code,
For those who understand the average computer at least a little bit. I used wineskin to pack this file from exe to app for us macos users. Sadly we don't get a lot of macos games. :(
